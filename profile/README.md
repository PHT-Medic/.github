# PHT-meDIC

In this organization you can find the code for the PHT-meDIC project.

## Documentation

More information about the project as well as detailed user and deployment guides can be found in 
the [documentation](https://docs.personalhealthtrain.de/).

## Components
Several Git repositories contain the components of the PHT. 
Third party components can be found on the respective manufacturer's site.
These components can be roughly separated into the following categories:

* central
* local

All **public** repositories can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/PHT-Medic).

### Central
Central components/services are individual packages within one monorepo. They include the implementation of the Central 
UI, Train Building, Train Routing, Result Extraction, API, etc., which supply the core functions of the PHT.

* `Harbor` - Harbor is a docker registry to distribute images. In the context of the PHT it is used for train distribution across multiple locations.
* `RabbitMQ` - RabbitMQ is a message broker. It is used for the communication between microservices.
* `Vault` - Vault is a secret storage service for managing and storing sensitive information.

#### Local
Local/Station components/services are packages utilized in local setups by analysts and administrators. The Station 
repository is used to set up local stations by administrators. The Desktop App implements a released version of
the local PHT tool, necessary for the encryption of stations and signing/decryption of trains.
